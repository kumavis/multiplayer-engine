TODO

- [ ] use SM on frontend
- [ ] update state transition to handle new actions (join/leave)
- [ ] breakout into lib and example

### etc
measure latency
interpolate
predict
correct
broadcast diffs since confirmed tick

? how to synchronize tick rate / avoid drift

Server message:
  current tick
  world state

Client message:
  last heard tick
  actions for tick


current = lastTick+roundTripDelay/2

hub-spoke over un/reliable streams


client -> server -> peers

client network output: small packets 20-30/s
server simulates world 33/s, transmits 20/s

client performs prediction + interpolation

advanced: lag compensation
advanced: client can specify lower update rate

client sends actions
server sends diffs since last acknowedged update
or full snapshots (e.g. on start, or long delay)
